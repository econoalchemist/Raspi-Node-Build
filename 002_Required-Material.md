- Keyboard, I used an old one I had laying around.

- Mouse, I used an old one I had laying around.

- 64GB Micro SD card, this came with the Cana Kit.

- External SSD with a minimum 500GB capacity, I used an old one I had laying around. However, if you want to use a 512GB MicroSD card be forewarned that there are many scams on Amazon and other market places. I purchased one from Amazon and it took me several attempts and a lot of time to figure out that the MicroSD card was not in fact 512GB.

- A separate, operating computer so you can format & preload your Micro SD card. I used an old Windows desktop.

- A good internet connection and access to the router admin settings.

- Ethernet cable, I used an old one I had laying around.
