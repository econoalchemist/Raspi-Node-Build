# Format the External SSD:

- Format an external hard drive on a separate computer.

- Open your disk management program again and delete all volumes & partitions on your external drive so it is completely blank.

- Now eject your SSD. Do not format it to any file system type. Do not create a new volume. This will be done on the Raspberry Pi later.

- This will be the storage media for your Bitcoin blockchain; as of this writing, Bitcoin blockchain = ~240GB.

- Do not connect your external drive to the Rasperry Pi yet.
