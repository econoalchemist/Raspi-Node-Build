# Be Fully Validating:

Make sure your node is accepting inbound connections, this is what helps support the network:

- Open a secondary shell and find your IP address by typing $ curl ifconfig.me;

- This should return something like "83.160.81.177"

- Navigate to: https://bitnodes.earn.com/#join-the-network

- Enter that IP address and hit "CHECK NODE"

- You should see a green text box validating that your node is connected and accepting inbound requests

- You may need to log into your router and set up port forwarding to 8333
