# Setting up TOR:

You don't have to use TOR, but it's a good idea if you're into privacy. I'm putting the TOR instructions here because I chose to set up TOR after configuring BitcoinCore and downloading the entire blockchain, unfortunately my node is not connecting through TOR so I suspect that if I had done these steps at the beginning instead of the end then it may have worked. If you want to reference the site where I found these instructions, navigate to https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/raspibolt_20_pi.html and see the section on Privacy. Or you can just skip the TOR section.

`$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list;` 

This will open a file you need to edit.

`$ deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org buster main;` 

Add this line after the existing line.

`$ deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org buster main;` 

Add this line after that then press "ctl+x" to exit, "y" for yes, & "enter" for yes.

`$ sudo apt install dirmngr apt-transport-https;`

`$curl 
https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --import;`

`$ gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -;`

`$ sudo apt update;`

`$ sudo apt install tor;`

`$ tor --version;`

This should return "Tor version 0.4.1.6." (or higher).

`$ systemctl status tor;`

Press "ctl+c" to exit.

`$ cat /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc;`

This should return a few lines with "User debian-tor" in them.

`$ cat /etc/group | grep debian-tor;`

This should return "debian-tor117:x:" or something similar.

`$ sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor pi;`

My user is "pi". Use whatever user you set up. Or if you left it default like I did, enter "pi".

`$ cat /etc/group | grep debian-tor;`

Now it should return "debian-tor117:x:pi" 

`$ sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc;`

This will open another text file you need to edit by removing the hashtag signs (#) from the following lines (You need to scroll down to find them).

Uncomment:

`ControlPort 9051`

`CookieAuthentication 1`

Add:

`CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1`

`$ sudo systemctl restart tor;`

Now restart your Raspberry Pi.
