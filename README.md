If you value privacy and do not want the NSA to have access to your Bitcoin node, read this article and take this information into consideration. There is a potential backdoor to the Raspberry Pi's and if you want to build something on this hardware you should be aware of this potential risk. I have not confirmed this risk personally but it is worth considering. Thank you [@LukeDashjr](https://www.twitter.com/lukedashjr) for sharing this article with me.
